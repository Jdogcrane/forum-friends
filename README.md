# Forum-Friends

## Description
Forum Friends is an application that allows users to message with other users in a format similar to a traditional forum or message board. After a user signs up or logs in (if they already have an account) they are then allowed to make posts and comment on posts created by other users. 

Numerous node packages were used to create the backend/database side of the application. We used the Materialize CSS framework to assist in developing the front-end.
